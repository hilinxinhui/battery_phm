abstract = {Summary
Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in many important applications. However, there are still many challenges facing lithium-ion batteries, one of them being degradation. Battery degradation is a complex problem, which involves many electrochemical side reactions in anode, electrolyte, and cathode. Operating conditions affect degradation significantly and therefore the battery lifetime. It is of extreme importance to achieve accurate predictions of the remaining battery lifetime under various operating conditions. This is essential for the battery management system to ensure reliable operation and timely maintenance and is also critical for battery second-life applications. After introducing the degradation mechanisms, this paper provides a timely and comprehensive review of the battery lifetime prognostic technologies with a focus on recent advances in model-based, data-driven, and hybrid approaches. The details, advantages, and limitations of these approaches are presented, analyzed, and compared. Future trends are presented, and key challenges and opportunities are discussed.}

    abstract = { Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in electric vehicles, smart grids and many other applications as energy storage devices, for which the aging assessment is crucial to guarantee their safe and reliable operation. The battery capacity is a popular indicator for assessing the battery aging, however, its accurate estimation is challenging due to a range of time-varying situation-dependent internal and external factors. Traditional simplified models and machine learning tools are difficult to capture these characteristics. As a class of deep neural networks, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is powerful to capture hidden information from a huge amount of input data, making it an ideal tool for battery capacity estimation. This paper proposes a CNN-based battery capacity estimation method, which can accurately estimate the battery capacity using limited available measurements, without resorting to other offline information. Further, the proposed method only requires partial charging segment of voltage, current and temperature curves, making it possible to achieve fast online health monitoring. The partial charging curves have a fixed length of 225 consecutive points and a flexible starting point, thereby short-term charging data of the battery charged from any initial state-of-charge can be used to produce accurate capacity estimation. To employ CNN for capacity estimation using partial charging curves is however not trivial, this paper presents a comprehensive approach covering time series-to-image transformation, data segmentation, and CNN configuration. The CNN-based method is applied to two battery degradation datasets and achieves root mean square errors (RMSEs) of less than 0.0279 Ah (2.54\%) and 0.0217 Ah (2.93\% ), respectively, outperforming existing machine learning methods. }

abstract = {Lithium-ion battery technologies play a key role in transforming the economy reducing its dependency on fossil fuels. Transportation, manufacturing, and services are being electrified. The European Commission predicts that in Europe everything that can be electrified will be electrified within a decade. The ability to accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is crucial to ensure the safety of the operation of battery-powered electric devices and to guide users taking behaviors that can extend battery life and re-usability. In this paper, we investigate how machine learning models can predict the SOC of cylindrical Li-Ion batteries considering a variety of cells under different charge-discharge cycles.},

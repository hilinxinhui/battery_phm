# Abstract

Lithium-ion batteries have become crucial components of electric vehicle power systems due to their long lifespan, high energy density, and environmental friendliness. To ensure system reliability and promote the economic benefits of power battery cascading utilization, it is necessary to predict the battery's state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL). However, the application of physics-based models faces challenges such as modeling difficulties, high computational complexity, and poor generalization ability. This study conducts research on data-driven methods for estimating battery SOH and predicting RUL, based on battery cycling data, without relying on battery mechanisms.

Firstly, utilizing an open-source dataset of lithium-ion battery cycling, this work investigates the variations of parameters during the operation of lithium-ion batteries, with particular focus on discharge capacity, charge-discharge voltage, current, battery surface temperature, and state of charge (SOC). Subsequently, battery state of health (SOH) estimation is performed using historical capacity data as input. This paper accomplishes this by implementing a autoregressive (AR) model, a support vector regression (SVR) model, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, a long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) model, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, evaluating their predictive performance on the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of data-driven battery SOH estimation methods, with the CNN model exhibiting the highest prediction accuracy among the aforementioned models. Furthermore, addressing the challenges of non-destructive measurement and online application of battery capacity, this paper constructs samples based on directly observable time series during the lithium-ion battery cycling process. A CNN model is then developed for battery SOH estimation using these directly observable features and is evaluated on the dataset for its predictive performance. The experimental results indicate the feasibility of the SOH estimation method based on directly observable features. Comparing the predictive performance of the CNN model when using charge-discharge voltage, current, and battery surface temperature as features to that when using charge-discharge voltage, current, and battery charge as features, the experimental results demonstrate higher prediction accuracy when the latter set of features is employed. Additionally, this paper proposes a time series to image transformation and compares the predictive performance of the CNN model when using time series samples as input to that when using the transformed images as input. The experimental results indicate that employing the transformed images as input significantly reduces the number of model parameters while maintaining the prediction accuracy. Lastly, this paper investigates the problem of predicting battery RUL and proposes an Ah-RUL definition based on battery discharge capacity. This paper develops a deep LSTM model that takes battery charge-discharge voltage, current, and surface temperature as input for Ah-RUL prediction, and evaluate its predictive performance on the dataset. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this prediction model.
